### Installation

**Local Development**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dmcguire80/Budget-Reduction-Tracking.git
cd Budget-Reduction-Tracking

# Setup script (handles PostgreSQL, dependencies, migrations)
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Or manual setup:
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database connection
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev  # Runs on port 3001

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev  # Runs on port 5173
```

**Production Deployment (Proxmox LXC)**
```bash
# See detailed guide in docs/DEPLOYMENT.md
# Quick deploy script:
./scripts/deploy-lxc.sh
```

### Environment Configuration

See `.env.example` files in `backend/` and `frontend/` directories for required environment variables.

## Screenshots
